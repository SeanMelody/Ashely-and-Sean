                        October has the best weather for San Francisco, you can expect mid 70 degree sunny days,
                        but be aware that it could get a little chilly at the wedding under the Redwood trees.

                        There is limited parking at Stern Grove, but there are two small lots if you are feeling lucky,
                        or you can park on the street, though be aware of the San Francisco hills.

                        We politely ask that you do not wear stiletto heels. Or any tall heels. There are a bunch of
                        grassy/dirt areas that you have to walk in so we ask that you wear chunky heels or sandals.
                        Also we want everyone's feet to be comfortable
